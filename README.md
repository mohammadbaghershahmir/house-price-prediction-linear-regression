# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using Linear Regression to predict house area based on features like price, number of rooms, and address. The dataset is processed and split into training and test sets, and model performance is evaluated using MSE and R².

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error and R-squared

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mohammadbaghershahmir/house-price-prediction-linear-regression.git
   ```
2. Make sure your CSV file (`housePrice.csv`) is located in the correct path or adjust the code accordingly.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python Q-One.py
   ```

## 📈 Sample Output
```
Mean Squared Error: <value>
R-squared: <value>
```
